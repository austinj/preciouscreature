<p><strong>Precious Creature is a full-time alternative pet aftercare business/passion</strong> located in the sleepy city of Redlands, just an hour east of Los Angeles. With a lifelong love of animals, art, and death care, owner and trained taxidermist Lauren Kane marries all three together to bring a renewed vision to pet aftercare.</p>
<p>We are mostly a one-woman operation, but we also receive assistance from our magnificent apprentice Triss Krohne, our internet helper Austin, and our partnered colleagues at Paws and Claws Aquamation and Memorials, Gateway Pet Cemetery, and Valley Fur Shed Tannery. Our work has been featured in media including the New York Times and books on death and taxidermy.</p>
<p>Lauren lives in a cozy neighborhood with her familiar Laika. She is inspired by Victorian and world mourning practices, natural history, pets here and here no longer, and star-crossed souls.</p>
