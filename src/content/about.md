**Precious Creature is a full-time alternative pet aftercare business/passion** located in the sleepy city of Redlands, just an hour east of Los Angeles. With a lifelong love of animals, art, and death care, owner and expert taxidermist Lauren Kane marries all three together to bring a renewed vision to pet aftercare. We have worked with over 350 families, and are always happy to provide references regarding our services upon request.

We are mostly a one-woman operation, but we also receive assistance from our magnificent apprentice Triss Krohne, our internet helper Austin, and our partnered colleagues at Paws and Claws Aquamation and Memorials, Gateway Pet Cemetery, and Valley Fur Shed Tannery. Our work has been featured in [books](https://www.ebbartels.com/good-grief/), newspapers ([1](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/deceased-pet-home-memorials-62ac5827?st=6ht1x1x4gb608z6&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink), [2](https://nypost.com/2017/05/16/these-extremely-loving-owners-preserve-their-pets-for-eternity/)), podcasts ([1](https://www.ellekayetaxidermy.co.uk/podcast-1/episode/22ca8fec/lauren-kane-pet-mortician), [2](https://www.griefdreams.ca/podcast/134), [3](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/nassology)), and [fancy zines](https://www.theodradek.com/).

Lauren lives in a cozy neighborhood with her familiar Laika. She is inspired by Victorian and world mourning practices, natural history, pets here and here no longer, and star-crossed souls.
