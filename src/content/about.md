Precious Creature is a full-time alternative pet aftercare business/passion located in the magical Mojave desert, just outside of Joshua Tree National Park in the city of Twentynine Palms. With a lifelong love of animals, art, and death care, owner and trained taxidermist Lauren Kane marries all three together to bring a renewed vision to pet aftercare.

We are mostly a one-woman operation, but we also receive assistance from our lovely apprentice, Magnolia Mills, and our partnered colleagues at Paws and Claws Aquamation and Memorials, Gateway Pet Cemetery, and Valley Fur Shed Tannery. Lauren lives in a cozy desert neighborhood with her familiars, Laika, Mortimer, and Fiore. We're inspired by Victorian and world mourning practices, natural history, pets here and here no longer, and star-crossed souls.
